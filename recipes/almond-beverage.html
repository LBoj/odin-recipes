    <h1>Almond <s>Milk</s> Beverage</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Milk lobbyists came to my house last night with a nutcracker and made me watch as they cracked several almonds right before my eyes.</p>
    <p>Then they said, "This is what could happen to you if you don't reword some things on your new recipes website."</p>
    <p>The FBI were no help at all and I think they might be in the pocket of Big Milk.</p>
    <p>I did my best, but I'm scared. I don't know when or if they're going to come back to hurt my poor baby almonds again.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A transparent, performative Container (e.g. a glass or jar) to attract attention to <s>the creamy, milky consistency</s> the fact that you're <em>NOT</em> in any way, shape, or form drinking milk</li>
        <li>1 freshly picked, unshelled Almond</li>
        <li>Black Pepper because everything's better with pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Locate your Almond's udders. These are often found on the underside of the animal.</li>
        <li>Squeeze said udders until your Container is full. One unshelled Almond can produce six to seven gallons of beverage per day.</li>
        <li>Season with Black Pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve and inhale.</li>
    </ol>

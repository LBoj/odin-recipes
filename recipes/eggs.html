    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"EGGS!"</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"<em>EGGS!</em> You heard what I said. How do you like yours? I hope you said over hard."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enough EVOO to lightly coat your pan</li>
        <li>2 Eggs or more depending on the situation</li>
        <li>Salt or Garlic Salt if you're feeling spicy</li>
        <li>Black Pepper because everything's better with pepper</li>
        <li>Parsley if you're feeling those cottage core vibes today</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Oil your pan. Get that EVOO nice and hot so that it starts jumping up out of there. When you feel the sting, you know it's ready.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to medium. Crack n slap those Eggs down and listen to that <em>szzzz</em>.</li>
        <li>Season with Salt, Pepper, and Parsley.</li>
        <li>When those bad boys start to turn brown at the edges, flip em and wait a bit.</li>
        <li>Serve and gobble.</li>
    </ol>
